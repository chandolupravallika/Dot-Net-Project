Department website project
I have developed a department website using ASP.NET, Here the professors & students can register ,login and then professors can create the courses and then submit the individual students marks for each course and they can generate reports of marks for each course and also they can send messages to students and professors.
And students can register to the available courses and can view the marks of the course and can send messages to professors and students.
